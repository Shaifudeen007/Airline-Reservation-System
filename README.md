###### My Java code implements a console-based Airline Reservation System that allows both admin and customer interactions. It uses object-oriented programming principles to define Flight and Booking classes, managing flight details and passenger reservations respectively. Admins can view and add new flights, while customers can browse available flights, book tickets, and cancel bookings using a unique PNR. The system efficiently handles data using Javaâ€™s ArrayList and provides real-time seat availability updates upon booking or cancellation. It demonstrates strong fundamentals in Java such as class structures, collections, user input handling via Scanner, and control flow, making it a great foundational project for understanding Java application development.
